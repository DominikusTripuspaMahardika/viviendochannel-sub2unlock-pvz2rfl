        (F.A.Q)</h2>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>🔸 Why is the free data not the same as the one in the video?</h3>
        <p>The free data available is a limited demo version. To get the
          appropriate premium version as shown in the video, please contact the
          admin through the official ViVienDoChannel platform.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>🔸 Do I have to subscribe to all channels to get free data?</h3>
        <p>Yes. To unlock the free Save Data, you must support all our official
          platforms — YouTube, Instagram, and Telegram. This requirement helps
          us continue developing and sharing high-quality content with the
          community. Once you've interacted with all three, the download button
          will activate automatically.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>🔸 Is free data safe to use?</h3>
        <p>Yes, both free and premium versions have been tested and guaranteed
          100% safe. All Save Data files come directly from the official
          ViVienDoChannel team without any malicious modifications such as
          viruses or malware. In addition, game progress can be directly synced
          using an EA or Google Play Games account safely, without the risk of
          being banned. We uphold data integrity and official compatibility.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>🔸 Can this Save Data be used in all versions of the game?</h3>
        <p>Save Data provided can be used on all official versions of Plants vs
          Zombies 2, both old and new. However, this data is not compatible with
          third-party modified versions such as Plants vs Zombies 2
          Reflourished, Plants vs Zombies 2 Shuttle, and other similar mods. For
          the best and most stable experience, we recommend using the official
          application downloaded from the Google Play Store or App Store.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>🔸 Why download link uses Mediafire?</h3>
        <p>We choose Mediafire for its reliability, fast and consistent download
          speeds, and global accessibility. It ensures that all users—regardless
          of region—can download the Save Data smoothly without login or account
          requirements.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>🔸 I have subscribed but the download button is not active,
          why?</h3>
        <p>Please ensure you have clicked each platform button (YouTube,
          Instagram, and Telegram) from this page itself. The system detects
          interactions via these buttons. Once all actions are registered, the
          progress bar will fill, and the download button will become active
          automatically.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>🔸 Are there any updates for Save Data in the future?</h3>

        <h3>🔸 Can this Save Data be used to complete the entire game?</h3>

          items, unlocked levels, and high progress. However, you can still go
          ahead and customize your progress to suit your playstyle. This
          provides flexibility without losing the fun of playing.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">

          What should I do?</h3>
        <p>Please refresh the page and try clicking the buttons one by one
          again. Make sure you are not blocking pop-ups or using data saving
          mode/ad blocking extensions that may interfere with click detection.

          assistance.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>🔸 Can this Save Data be used offline?</h3>
